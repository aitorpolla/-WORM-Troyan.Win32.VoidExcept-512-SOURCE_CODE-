What is Troyan.Win32.VoidExcept-512? ðŸ’€ðŸ˜µ
- Don't worry, bro. It'll be a Trojan that they'll release soon. I'm one of the workers working on the effects for this Trojan. We also have the MBR ready, but most of the effects need to be put together. We'll release the parts every so often until it's all called "all.cpp."
