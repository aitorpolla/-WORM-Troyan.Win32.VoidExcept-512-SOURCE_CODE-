# -WORM-Troyan.Win32.VoidExcept-512-SOURCE_CODE-

What is Troyan.Win32.VoidExcept-512? 💀😵
- Don't worry, bro. It'll be a Trojan that they'll release soon. I'm one of the workers working on the effects for this Trojan. We also have the MBR ready, but most of the effects need to be put together. We'll release the parts every so often until it's all called "all.cpp."

What's its characteristic? 🏆
-All effects must have some black or white, representing the struggle between real and faded colors. This is reflected in the MBR payload.

-😈 For Skidders, I have GOOD NEWS! 🔥-
- You can use the code FREELY! No credits, due to the replicated effects you might try with "WormGPT." I don't want you to get screwed, it's FREE SRC!

- SPECIAL CREDITS TO: 👀
! Aitor Firmware For creating the MBR effects! 😵
! Clutch (CYBER SOLDIER) For inspiring me! 😵
And GDI for allowing me to create this work, possibly Masterpiece?
